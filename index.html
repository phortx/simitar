# Simitar
Simple, lightwight, Bootstrap-based, Markdown-powered document generation WITHOUT any server side procession. It's just plain JavaScript (driven by buring hamsters running in circles to provide infinite energy - nothing is perfect)

Want to see that in action? Visit http://phortx.github.com/simitar/ it's fully generated by simitar (and github-pages)


# Why?
Many time I just want to put a nice formatted document somewhere on my server to provide an howto for someone, write down some things for myself, share concepts, and so on. But plain HTML takes much effort to write and looks really ugly without any CSS. I just want to write text, not CSS. So a framework would be nice. Markdown would be nice. But server side processing is needless overhead for that use case. So what I want is a very easy, lightwight but yet powerful way to write documents fast on the webserver and share them with a fancy, readable layout and stuff. So simitar was born!


# Features
* Very easy to use: Just place a HTML file somewhere on the Webserver, write some markdown and be happy
* No installation required, just use it!
* Fancy and readable Layout
* Themable
* Uses GitHub flavored Markdown for content formatting
* Special Markdown syntax extension for the easy usage of Font Awesome Icons (Hell yeah!)
* Use any bootstrap feature!
* Syntax highlighting


# Usage
Simitar doesn't require any installation since there is no server side code. You just place a HTML file, include the simitar script, wirte your markdown. Then the webserver will deliver the HTML file to the clients where the JavaScript will do the rest.

Example HTML file:

<pre class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Simple example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://raw.github.com/phortx/simitar/gh-pages/v/0.1/_.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

# Hello, world!
Your markdown goes _here_

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

As you see, theres no magic. Just place your markdown in the body and make sure the script tag in somewhere in your HTML file.

**Hint:** You can even use any HTML markup you want in the body, just mix it with your markdown, it will work!
**Attention:** Be careful if you want to display HTML-Code. You should replace all <code>&lt;</code> with <code>&amp;lt;</code>, same with <code>&gt;</code> and wrap it in a <code>pre</code>-Tag.


# Icons, baby!
Font Awesome icons may be used via the special simitar icon markdown syntax:
```
{{hand-right}} This text got an icon.
```

Results in:

<div class="well">{{hand-right}} This text got an icon.</div>

You find all icons on the [Bootstrap Icons Overview](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#icons).
Just take the name next to the icon, remove the "icon-" part and place the name between double braces: <code>{{ }}</code>.


# Themes
Theming is pretty simple. You know bootswatch.com? Now you do. Just take the name of a theme you like and put it as class name into your body, prefixed with "theme-":

<pre class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Simple theming example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://raw.github.com/phortx/simitar/gh-pages/v/0.1/_.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body class="theme-cosmos"&gt;

# Hello, world!
This is the **Cosmos Theme**!

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
